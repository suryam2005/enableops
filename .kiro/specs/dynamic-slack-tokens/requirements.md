# Requirements Document

## Introduction

EnableOps is an AI-powered multi-tenant SaaS platform that provides autonomous onboarding and internal operations support. Currently, the system uses a single global Slack bot token, which prevents true multi-tenancy and limits scalability. To achieve enterprise-grade multi-tenancy as outlined in the PRD, the system must implement dynamic bot token management where each workspace installation receives its own isolated bot instance with proper tenant separation, security, and scalability.

This feature is critical for EnableOps to support 100+ active tenants as targeted in the success metrics, while maintaining strict data isolation and security compliance required for enterprise customers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workspace admin, I want to install EnableOps through Slack's App Directory so that my organization can access AI-powered internal operations support with complete tenant isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workspace admin clicks "Add to Slack" THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth 2.0 flow with proper scopes (chat:write, app_mentions:read, channels:history, users:read)
2. WHEN OAuth authorization completes THEN the system SHALL receive workspace-specific bot token, team info, and installer details
3. WHEN installation data is received THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields (team_id, team_name, access_token, bot_user_id, installer_id)
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL create a new tenant record with unique tenant_id, plan assignment, and feature flags
5. WHEN tenant creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL store encrypted bot token with tenant association in Supabase
6. IF installation fails at any step THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging and rollback any partial data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As the EnableOps platform, I want to maintain complete tenant isolation so that each workspace operates independently with their own bot instance, data, and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving any Slack event THEN the system SHALL identify the tenant using team_id from the event payload
2. WHEN processing tenant requests THEN the system SHALL retrieve and use only that tenant's bot token from the database
3. WHEN making Slack API calls THEN the system SHALL use tenant-specific HTTP client instances with proper token isolation
4. WHEN storing any data THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant_id scoping on all database operations
5. WHEN a tenant's bot token is invalid THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully without affecting other tenants
6. WHEN multiple tenants make simultaneous requests THEN the system SHALL process them concurrently with proper isolation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workspace admin, I want EnableOps to automatically provision my organization's environment so that my team can immediately access AI assistance with company-specific context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installation completes THEN the system SHALL create an admin user profile with full permissions for the installer
2. WHEN tenant provisioning starts THEN the system SHALL generate sample company documents (welcome guide, EnableBot usage guide)
3. WHEN document creation completes THEN the system SHALL vectorize content and store embeddings for RAG functionality
4. WHEN provisioning finishes THEN the system SHALL send personalized welcome message with setup instructions to the installer
5. WHEN auto-setup encounters errors THEN the system SHALL complete core installation but queue failed items for retry
6. WHEN provisioning completes THEN the system SHALL set tenant status to "active" and enable all subscribed features

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a SaaS platform operator, I want comprehensive installation tracking and tenant lifecycle management so that I can monitor growth, handle billing, and provide enterprise support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any installation event occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed event data (timestamp, team_info, installer_details, scopes, plan_assignment)
2. WHEN tracking installation metrics THEN the system SHALL record conversion funnel data (initiated, completed, activated, churned)
3. WHEN a workspace uninstalls THEN the system SHALL mark tenant as inactive, preserve data for 90 days, and trigger billing adjustments
4. WHEN a workspace reinstalls THEN the system SHALL reactivate existing tenant, update bot token, and restore previous configuration
5. WHEN installation volume exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger scaling alerts and auto-scaling procedures
6. WHEN generating reports THEN administrators SHALL access tenant growth, activation rates, and health metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious enterprise customer, I want EnableOps to implement enterprise-grade security practices so that my organization's data remains protected and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing bot tokens THEN the system SHALL encrypt using AES-256 with tenant-specific keys and proper key rotation
2. WHEN handling OAuth flows THEN the system SHALL validate state parameters, implement CSRF protection, and use secure redirect URIs
3. WHEN processing API requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per tenant and validate all webhook signatures
4. WHEN accessing tenant data THEN the system SHALL enforce row-level security policies and audit all data access
5. WHEN tokens expire or become invalid THEN the system SHALL implement automatic token refresh flows where possible
6. WHEN security incidents occur THEN the system SHALL isolate affected tenants and trigger incident response procedures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an employee using EnableOps, I want seamless AI assistance that works reliably across all company channels so that I can get instant help with HR, IT, and policy questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I mention @EnableBot in any channel THEN the system SHALL respond using my workspace's dedicated bot instance
2. WHEN I send direct messages to EnableBot THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context within my tenant's isolated environment
3. WHEN EnableBot responds THEN all messages SHALL appear from my workspace's EnableBot with consistent branding and permissions
4. WHEN multiple team members use EnableBot simultaneously THEN each SHALL receive personalized responses based on their user profile and role
5. WHEN system issues occur THEN I SHALL receive clear, actionable error messages without exposing technical details
6. WHEN using EnableBot features THEN response times SHALL meet SLA requirements (under 3 seconds average as per PRD)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want the token management system to support horizontal scaling so that EnableOps can handle 100+ concurrent tenants as outlined in the growth targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system load increases THEN the token management system SHALL scale horizontally without affecting tenant isolation
2. WHEN caching bot tokens THEN the system SHALL implement distributed caching with proper invalidation strategies
3. WHEN database connections increase THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling with tenant-aware load balancing
4. WHEN processing webhook events THEN the system SHALL implement async processing queues with tenant-based routing
5. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the platform SHALL track per-tenant metrics and overall system performance
6. WHEN capacity limits approach THEN the system SHALL trigger auto-scaling and alert operations teams

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want EnableOps to maintain detailed audit trails so that our organization can meet regulatory requirements and security audits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any tenant operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log immutable audit records with timestamp, actor, action, and affected resources
2. WHEN bot tokens are accessed THEN the system SHALL log token usage without exposing sensitive values
3. WHEN data is accessed or modified THEN the system SHALL record tenant_id, user_id, operation type, and data classification
4. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN the system SHALL provide tenant-scoped audit trails with proper data retention
5. WHEN audit data is queried THEN the system SHALL enforce proper access controls and data minimization principles
6. WHEN retention periods expire THEN the system SHALL automatically purge audit data according to compliance policies
